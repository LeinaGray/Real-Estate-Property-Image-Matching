This pre-selling condo in Manila is proof of the camaraderie, mutual respect, and long-standing friendship between Japan and the Philippines that has surpassed over six (6) decades.

A Japanese Condo Living
The future residents at Kizuna Heights will experience Japanese-style condo living where people or investors can find their ""Ikigai,"" which is a combination of two Japanese words ""iki,"" which means ""life,"" and ""gai,"" which is used to represent value or worth. The Japanese way of life promises happiness, meaning, a sense of purpose, and motivation. The Ikigai lifestyle is about aiming for a delicate balance between pursuing one's professional goals and life. By staying on top of one's game and living the life that anyone would always dream of. Of course, to be surrounded by people they love. Lastly, give back to the community that helped you achieve your aspirations.

A Japanese Condo Living

Developed by Landco Pacific Corp and Roxaco Land Corp in the late 1980s, this 88-hectare coastline was transformed into a sustainable luxury paradise that has set the benchmark for high-end lifestyles in the country.  Punta Fuego offers a unique blend of leisure, adventure, and community and is just a two-hour drive from Metro Manila. The name Punta Fuego was derived from the Spanish word Fuego! which means ""Fire!"" and was used as a command during battles in the 1600s.  Designed by renowned architects Carlos Arguelles and Ed Calma, the properties in Punta Fuego were developed with the preservation of natural features in mind. The developers emphasized environmental sensitivity by integrating natural green spaces and native plants into the plans while maintaining luxurious modern amenities for comfort, safety, and property value.  Punta Fuego offers an exclusive community that took decades to build, with world-class experiences and effortless beachfront living. The core infrastructure and amenities of Club Punta Fuego were established first, which includes the Main Club, Beach Club, Casitas, a nine-hole golf course, tennis courts, a spa, children's facilities, private beaches, and marina facilities.  Residential spaces were then developed, from luxury villas and single-family homes to condominiums built and designed specifically for a high-end clientele. The generous living spaces were designed to honor the region's colonial heritage and rich history through a Spanish-Mediterranean architectural style with touches of Asian-tropical influences to create a distinct ambiance and sense of place.  The Residences at Terrazas de Punta Fuego is the final project in Punta Fuego, an elite address with only 132 low-density units available. The building is beachfront and easily accessible, with no need to ride a shuttle. The pristine beach and units with optimum sea view make it an ideal personal paradise for those who appreciate the value of investing in their legacy.  The price includes a parking slot. The units are semi-furnished, and Terrazas is a developed community.  If you're looking for an exclusive community with generously spacious living spaces, The Residences at Terrazas de Punta Fuego is your perfect address. Build your extraordinary life at this premier luxury seaside getaway in the Philippines.  Call the seller for payment terms of your choice: cash or deferred payment with a 10% to 25% discount.

The subject property is a 2-story residential structure with a basement, featuring modern/conventional design elements and constructed with high-quality materials. The layout is as follows.
Lower Ground – The lower ground is fully finished, and it includes a 1-bedroom unit that shows wear and requires renovation.

NEIGHBORHOOD AND LOCATION
The subject property is along an 8-meter-wide barangay road in El Progreso, Carmen, Bohol, Philippines. The elevation is within road level, about 452 meters from the National Highway. It is an area where the trend of land utilization is predominantly agricultural. Generally, the barangay access road adjacent to the property is unpaved and not yet developed or cemented, which may affect accessibility during adverse weather conditions but still supports light to moderate vehicular traffic, essential for agricultural operations and transportation of goods.
El Progreso is a barangay in the municipality of Carmen, in the province of Bohol. Its population as determined by the 2020 census was 961. This represented 1.9% of the total population of Carmen. The population of El Progreso grew from 787 in 1990 to 961 in 2020, an increase of 174 people over the course of 30 years. The latest census figures in 2020 denote a positive growth rate of 1.63%, or an increase of 71 people, from the previous population of 890 in 2015.

LAND DATA
Based on the documents received, the property has a total lot area of 10,059 square meters with Transfer Certificate of Title No. 101-2013000707 The property includes a large open space currently utilized as a rice field, covering approximately 3,000 square meters.

The rice field benefits from adequate irrigation and is easily accessible via the adjacent barangay road, supporting the transportation of harvested goods.
The large open space surrounding the property, either in the front or back of the house, presents the opportunity for further development, such as constructing a swimming pool. The flat terrain and ample land area provide ideal conditions for this enhancement, which could increase the property’s recreational value and market appeal. Such an addition would be particularly attractive for residential or resort-style development in the future.","Balcony, Basement, Driver's room, Terrace, Air conditioning, Broadband internet available, Entertainment room, Storage Room, Wi-Fi, Garage, Jogging path, Open car spaces, Secure parking, Balcony, Garden, Landscaped Garden, Playground, Open space","https://static-ph.lamudi.com/static/media/bm9uZS9ub25l/2x2x5x880x450/195f25ae1d6927.jpg, https://static-ph.lamudi.com/static/media/bm9uZS9ub25l/2x2x5x380x244/799b6c6e819471.jpg, https://static-ph.lamudi.com/static/media/bm9uZS9ub25l/2x2x5x380x244/3088f813ff0a8a.jpg, https://static-ph.lamudi.com/static/media/bm9uZS9ub25l/2x2x5x380x244/c085cec98e7e1d.jpg, https://static-ph.lamudi.com/static/media/bm9uZS9ub25l/2x2x5x380x244/8d753afeac66f8.jpg",https://www.lamudi.com.ph/buy/bohol/carmen-1/house-and-lot-for-sale-in-carmen-bohol-farmlot-1-h-172752621585/
